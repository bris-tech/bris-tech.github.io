  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>
  Bristech is a group of technically-minded people meeting up once a month
  for beer, pizza and some (hopefully) informative talks about new and
  interesting things that can be done in the world of computer programming.

  <p>
  We are not fussy about your language of choice, nor your professional
  background - we believe that there's something to learn from everything
  across the spectrum of programming. So whether you're a PHP guru, a C#
  enterprise developer, a Haskell researcher or an Arduino hobbyist, if
  you've got something interesting to tell us about, why not come and give
  us a talk?

  <p>
  Meetings are held on the first Thursday of each month, at the
  <a href="http://www.engine-shed.co.uk/">Engine Shed</a> near Temple Meads
  in the centre of Bristol:

I am a senior lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Creative Technologies at the University of the West of England and Theme Leader for Assisted Living at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory.
I have over 15 years of teaching and research experience working on externally funded projects with partners from a diverse range of commercial and industrial enterprise.

My multi-disciplinary background, underpinned by degrees in Electronic Systems Engineering, Biomedical Instrumentation Engineering and a PhD in Computer Science, enable me to address technical issues from a soft systems perspective in relation to human experience of technology in different contexts. My current portfolio of projects includes assistive technology to support older adults, CAD tools for sustainable construction, interactive evolutionary systems to support web design and locative media apps for students.

My teaching subject specialisms are Interaction Design and Human-Computer Interaction. I am available for consultancy work in user experience design and data mining.

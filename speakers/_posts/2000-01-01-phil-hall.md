Phil Hall is MD & Founder of Elzware Ltd, a company set up in 2002 with the specific objectives of opening up a conversational system marketplace in line with: available bandwidth, digital consumer devices and the general public’s desire to communicate with computers in natural language. 

Phil has been delivering practical, effective, resilient AI systems since 1999 originally when he was working as a consultant for Logica installing automated email response solutions. The bulk of build work has been pure chat systems on the basis of commercial and anthropological rationale, in recent years he has moved to open source engines. 

Prior to his commercial interests, he built furniture, ran production lines, mended sawmills and studied Anthropology as a mature student at University College London. His definitive research was an ethnography of online community during 1997/1998 where he focused on the implications for an individual’s sense of self in virtual environments. 

Phil’s objective is to create leading edge human interaction systems whether they are internal or external facing. On retirement he will no doubt leave a conversational clone of himself that will phone him at the beach/bar/workbench/garage only when it has exhausted what it knows about the conversation at hand.

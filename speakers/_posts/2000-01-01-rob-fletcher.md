Rob Fletcher has been developing web apps for 15 years. He's contributed to various open-source projects including Grails for which he worked on the core as well as developing a range of plugins. A *full-stack* developer, Rob enjoys wrangling CSS as much as optimizing database queries (i.e. he's equally likely to be swearing about either). Currently Rob is involved with Ratpack (a lightweight JVM web platform similar to Sinatra or Express) as well as Betamax (his own HTTP testing library). In his spare time Rob plays with his two sons and recovers by making cocktails.

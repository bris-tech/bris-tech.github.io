Seven years ago Thom gave up a programming job he loved in order to help software teams fix their broken management and engineering systems. Today he is working for an awesome team at HP on an OpenStack based cloud product. When he's not doing this he can be found playing lego with his children, running in knee-deep mud, listening to music or tinkering with open source software.

Sam is a hacker, masquerading as a software developer. He has never been, nor will he ever be a software developer - he loves hacking. Sam comes from an academic research background (you should look up my papersâ€¦ oh, wait, there are lots of papers written by Sam Davies - which one is the real one?) and hence has always used whatever tool was suitable for the job and just churned out throwaway code to discover whether his ideas are correct.

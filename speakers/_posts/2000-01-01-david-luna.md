David Luna is a software engineer who has lived in Bristol for four
years and joined the team at ForgeRock in 2013. Graduating from
Southampton with a masters in Computer Science in 2008 he tried being
self-employed in Sweden for two years before deciding that Bristol was
probably where he belongs. His day-to-day focus is on helping to bring
about massively scalable authentication systems through ForgeRock’s
flagship OpenAM product, and he gets rather too excited by login pages
for his own good. He’s nervous as all hell. Go nice.

From early beginnings transcribing BBC Basic source from The Micro User (http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/themicrouser/) and Acorn User (http://8bs.com/aumags.htm), to altering the QBasic 'Gorillas' source to turn a banana into a grenade, James has always been interested in programming. These days he is a Java developer for Scott Logic with an interest in Scala and, increasingly, JavaScript.

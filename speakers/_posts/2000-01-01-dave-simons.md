Dave is a technical lead for Softwire, working with teams to deliver the needs of a range of clients (including the BBC and Microsoft) by choosing and developing with the right tools for the job. Since he started coding professionally, he has worked extensively on full-stack systems, thinking deeply about everything from how to store data, to the pixel-perfect placement of images. When not writing code, Dave enjoys thinking and talking about inclusivity, statistics and beer.

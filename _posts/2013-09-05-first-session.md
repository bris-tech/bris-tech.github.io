When your application talks to external systems over HTTP the last thing you need is for third-party downtime, rate limiting, flaky integration environments or lack of network connectivity to make your tests unreliable. It's also vital to test how your application handles errors and unexpected responses which may not be easy to provoke deliberately.

Betamax isolates your unit tests from third-party collaborators that are not under your control by recording real HTTP exchanges to a *tape* that is played back when your tests run. Tapes can even be created and edited manually giving you the ability to simulate edge cases.

Nodecopter is a world wide hackday where you programmatically fly quadcopters with JavaScript, we'll look at how that's possible, what kinds of programs people have made and have some live demos too!

Well, our first session was not without hiccups - unfortunately <a href="{% post_url 2000-01-01-rob-fletcher %}">Rob Fletcher</a> had a bump at the motorway services on his way to Bristol, so <a href="{% post_url 2000-01-01-sam-davies %}">Sam Davies</a> stepped in at the last minute.

We’re all pretty genial people in our office, however, together with car parking, one of the topics that is always likely to get a response is the air conditioning. It’s a regular occurrence for people to be sat coding in their coats, but equally the meeting cupboard suffers from what can only be described as sauna-like properties.

I decided that I needed to buy a thermometer. I find that life is better with more data, and that we would all feel a lot better with some facts to backup our complaints.

I didn’t really want to just measure the temperature, I wanted to chart it. I wanted a chart of the temperature in lots of different places, all the time. I didn’t want to spend all day typing readings into a spreadsheet, so I needed to log it automatically. I needed an Arduino. Luckily my colleague had one - I ordered a thermistor and we were away.

Nodecopter is a world wide hackday where you programmatically fly quadcopters with JavaScript, we'll look at how that's possible, what kinds of programs people have made and have some live demos too!

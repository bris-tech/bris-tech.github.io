### The Science Behind Data Visualisation

Graham is a designer and developer working across desktop, web and mobile, with a particular taste for data visualisation.

He will be looking at some of the science behind data visualisation and will be delving deep into the inner workings of our visual cortex.

### Creative Coding with Clojure

Clojure is an exciting new dialect of Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. In this talk, we'll see what makes Clojure a great language for coding creative projects such as visualisations, games, synthesisers and web sites.

We'll start with a short explanation of Clojure's syntax before diving into some live coding. Absolute beginners and seasoned experts are all welcome!

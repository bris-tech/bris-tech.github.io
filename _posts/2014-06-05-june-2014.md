This month we've got  <a href="{% post_url 2000-01-01-adam-butler %}">Adam Butler</a> and 
<a href="{% post_url 2000-01-01-dan-cook %}">Dan Cook</a> joining us to give us talks about
AngularJS and Big Data in the Cloud.

### AngularJS and CoffeeScript

Details coming soon...

### Big Data in the Cloud

Big data and the cloud, isn't it just lots of data and VMs? A look at how architectures have 
evolved to deal with large volumes of data and the technologies that support them. A 
whistle-stop tour of a MongoDB sharded cluster, BigTable implementations, asking what's wrong 
with Oracle and enterprise search. Finally a quick look at Apache Zookeeper and a demo of how 
you can automatically failover your applications as it's probably all my laptop can handle.

This month we've got  <a href="{% post_url 2000-01-01-adam-butler %}">Adam Butler</a> and 
<a href="{% post_url 2000-01-01-dan-cook %}">Dan Cook</a> joining us to give us talks about
AngularJS and Big Data in the Cloud.

### AngularJS and CoffeeScript

AngularJS is a framework that helps you build scalable, high performance and powerful web 
applications. This talk is an isight into what AngularJS is, why you might need it and how 
it can help you build declarative data-driven agile applications that scale.

### Big Data in the Cloud

Big data and the cloud, isn't it just lots of data and VMs? A look at how architectures have 
evolved to deal with large volumes of data and the technologies that support them. A 
whistle-stop tour of a MongoDB sharded cluster, BigTable implementations, asking what's wrong 
with Oracle and enterprise search. Finally a quick look at Apache Zookeeper and a demo of how 
you can automatically failover your applications as it's probably all my laptop can handle.

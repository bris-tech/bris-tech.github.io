### Twelve Factor Applications - Roja Buck

Twelve factor applications adhere to a manifesto of ideas and a number of strict architecture decisions, 
in exchange they provide trivial deployability, rapid failure recovery and near arbitrary scalability. 
This talk will touch on each factor and review how it contributes towards a cohesive and compelling 
architecture.

### F# for C# Developers - Phil Trelford

This talk is for C# programmers (and interested others) who are curious about F#, a multi-paradigm and 
cross-platform programming language.

In: test driven development, classes and functions

Out: maths, monads and moth-eaten jumpers

Expect plenty of practical examples with live code samples, including interop between C# and F#.

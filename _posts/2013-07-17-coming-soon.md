Hello and thanks for dropping by. We're starting our new meetup group very soon
- please keep checking back to see what's going on.

Meetings will be held on the first Thursday of each month, starting September
2013. We welcome talks about anything IT-based - particularly, but not
exclusively, programming-centred. If you would like to present a talk, please
get in touch via our [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/bristechmeetup).

We look forward to seeing you soon!

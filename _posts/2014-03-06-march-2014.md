### Java 8 Lambdas

They've been a long time coming, but finally in version 8, Java catches up with the likes of C#, Python, Ruby and a host of other languages that support Lambda Functions. We'll take a look at what they are, how they're expressed, what API changes we can enjoy, and how they might change Java code.

### User Experience on a Shoestring

TBC

This month, we have a UX-themed evening with guest speakers Joe Leech (@mrjoe) and Graham Odds (@g_odds). Joe is a User Experience expert and published author, whilst Graham is a designer and developer working across desktop, web and mobile, with a particular taste for data visualisation.

Joe will be talking about his recent book 'Psychology for Designers' that is a guide to creativity.

Graham will be looking at the science behind Data Visualisation and will be delving deep into the inner workings of our visual cortex.

As usual, there will be beer and pizza after the two talks - we hope to see you there!

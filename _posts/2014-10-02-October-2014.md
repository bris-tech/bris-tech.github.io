### Open-source Licensing

There is much more to creating open source code than applying a licence to it. 
Successful open source projects eventually need to consider questions of 
governance, trademarks, and many more issues. In this talk, Upayavira will 
explain some of the issues that he has seen projects at the ASF struggle with, 
and share some of the solutions the ASF offers, and how these might apply to 
open source projects more generally.

### Why Scrum isn't Agile but you should be

The terms Agile and Scrum are used widely, synonymously, and often incorrectly. 
This talk aims to demonstrate that they are very different ideas, that aiming 
to do Scrum is not Agile, and that Agility is something worth aiming for.

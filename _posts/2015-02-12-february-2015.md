### Agile is not (always) the answer

Your software engineering process is important. As important as having brilliant people, a challenging vision, a working business model and disciplined engineering. These days we are told that an agile process such as scrum is what we should all be using. But this advice is as wrong and dogmatic as the waterfall process that it replaced.

### Choose your words wisely - UX Writing

A lot of the work we do as an industry involves writing websites and other applications to put in front of non-technical people - and we have to design everything accordingly. A lot of thought has already gone in to the images, colours and locations of items on a page. Despite this, we’re still a little behind the times whilst thinking about the words that we use. In this talk, I’ll discuss some of the ways that our words can influence people, and how we can leverage that in our work to make our software work for both our end-users, and ultimately, ourselves.

###  Responsive Game Design: Bringing your game to the living room - Simon Howard

So what are the things that you need to think about when bringing a mobile game to the living room? This is an interactive session where Simon will walk through that via a handy little game on his Amazon Fire TV. Beware: there will be some coding on the fly and he hopes a demo or two at the end of that. But you never can tell…

### Open source all the things! - Adam Butler

Until recently I had been working on a single project in my spare time for two years, I love it but I also hate it a little… ok, a lot I guess. So I made a change, I open-sourced it and released it, hopefully for the better at least it seems that way so far. I decided to do the same with everything else I’ve ever built (or at least the bits I have the code for) and everything that has come since. I want to talk about this change, why I made it and the good & bad that have followed.

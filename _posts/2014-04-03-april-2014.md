## Are we nearly there yet?  Practical tracking on Agile projects - Ric Hill

Ric has been in the software development industry for around 10 years, starting off as a hands-on developer before focusing on Agile project management. He now runs Softwire's Bristol office, but still finds himself doing bits of technical and "Agile transformation" consultancy.


As ever there will be food and drink a-plenty, so pop along, usual time, usual place.

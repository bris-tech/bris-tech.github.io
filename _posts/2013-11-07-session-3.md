### <a href="{% post_url 2000-01-01-jack-franklin %}">Jack Franklin</a>:  The new era of JavaScript

We're seeing more and more of the processing on sites being moved to the client site and done with JavaScript. In this talk we'll look at some approaches, libraries and frameworks for solving issues and even if we should be doing it at all. When is it a good idea to shift from server to client, and when should we stick to the traditional approach of all the heavy processing and work being done on the server?

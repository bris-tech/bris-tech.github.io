### Robot Swarms

Nanoparticles for cancer applications are increasingly able to move, sense, and interact 
the body in a controlled fashion, an affordance that has led them to be called robots. 
The challenge is to discover how trillions of nanobots can work together to improve the 
detection and treatment of tumors. Towards this end, the field of swarm robotics offers 
tools and techniques for controlling large numbers of robots with limited capabilities. 
Our swarm strategies are designed in realistic simulators using bio-inspiration, machine 
learning and crowdsourcing ([NanoDoc](http://nanodoc.org)). Strategies are then translated 
to large swarms of robots or preliminary tissue-on-a-chip devices.

### Git-fu - the art of GIT

A talk on some (lesser known) Git tip and tricks.

Have you done a git bisect? Do you make full use of the git graph? Do you know the 
difference between '..' and '...' ?

A practical tour of some of the less common tools and uses of git. Some git tricks could 
become a part of your regular "Git-fu", others might only come up to help you get out of 
a bind.

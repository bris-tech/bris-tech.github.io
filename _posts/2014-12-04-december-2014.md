### Microservices & Web Components Are The Same Thing

Microservices and web components are two of the next Next Big Steps for modern software 
development, for the server and client side respectively. Although involving quite different 
new tools and techniques though, in reality both of these developments share a common 
development practices heritage, as extensions of the same forward trend of good software 
design principles.

In this talk we'll first take a careful look at what on earth microservices and web components 
really are, and examine how you'd build full-stack Node.JS application using both of them. 
Weâ€™ll then discuss their shared underlying heritage, why these shared principles make both 
concepts so powerful in practice, and how you can use that more generally to design great 
applications in future.

### Danaboxes - What if Google was funded in the same way as Wikipedia? 

Thomas Buckley-Houston will be taking a technical look at the Platform As A Service paradigm 
(eg; Heroku) to see how it handles large scale traffic. And imaging what the Internet would 
be like if large scale applications like Google weren't dictated by corporate agendas.

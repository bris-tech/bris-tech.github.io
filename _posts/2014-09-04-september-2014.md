### FIDO Alliance, Passwordless Authentication

Passwords are crap. That’s the basic premise behind the thinking of the
FIDO Alliance, a collection of companies coming together to produce
specifications intent of bringing advancements to the problems facing
modern authentication. Their initial draft specifications for a
Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) and Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)
present a new paradigm for authentication, utilising public key
infrastructure with a focus on pluggable authentication via a user’s
personal, local device.

This brief talk will give a introduction to the FIDO Alliance, the core
principles of and the two current draft specifications, looking at new
ways of authenticating in the passwordless near-future.
